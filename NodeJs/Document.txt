Npm versioning: npm install lodash@a.b.c
a.b.c==> a is major when there is a change in functional of a package it will be updated
b is a minor version whenthere is a feature added to package the it will be updated
c is a patch version when bug is reolved it will be updated
In package.json if package is with carat symbol(^) it exclude major version ,if it is with ~ symbol it exclude both major and minor version and updates with lastest patch version.
If you want everything in updated version then use * in package.json file like: "lodash":"*".
